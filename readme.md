# YuuOS
## an unfinished version
This is kind of bigger project where I am trying to create much more secure and much more Unix-like OS for computercraft
but also keeping all the old APIs so there is maximal compatibility with CraftOS

# TODO
new File system
completely isolate kernel from OS
permission manager
shell
unix like standard commands(cat, man, stuff u know in linux and other unix like OS)
basic git program
X window
Package Manager


Right now, OS will be made basically again from roots because I wanna create some real safe kernel and this just couldn't work with it 

btw, big thanks to the CC community, without them I could never even start this project
